                        <p>Adobe Photoshop is an image creation, graphic design and photo editing software developed by Adobe. Some features include pixel based images, raster graphics & vector graphics. It was originally released in 1990.</p>
                        <hr class="thematic-break">
                        <p>This is an example of how I use Adobe Photoshop in my workflow. I create <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/au/en/warzone">Call Of Duty Warzone</a> thumbnails for YouTube and I use a variety of different tools & effects to create it. Consider watching the timelapse below and potentially adjusting the playback speed to 0.25x for an improved viewing experience.</p>
                        <div class="youtube-embed">
                            <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZZqydKCAuc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <p>The start of a YouTube thumbnail involves gathering two images. These are of the weapon & background. I capture these ingame and click WINDOWS + PRINT SCREEN on my keyboard to take a screenshot. The size of these images are 1920x1080p but the finished thumbnail should to be 1280x720p. Here's an example of each once imported into Photoshop.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="First Photoshop Example" alt="First Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/first-photoshop-example.png">
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Second Photoshop Example" alt="Second Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/second-photoshop-example.png">
                        <p>After I have both images, the next step is cutting out the weapon. I use the Pen Tool and slowly trace the whole weapon which generally takes between 10-30 minutes. After this, I click on "Paths" and click on "Work Path" which highlights the Pen Tool selection and then I can use the Eraser Tool to remove my selection. This is what it looks like with a transparent background.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Third Photoshop Example" alt="Third Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/third-photoshop-example.png">
                        <p>There are often several issues such as areas of the weapon which still need to be cut out (missed in initial cut out) and icons showing up which have to be removed. The icons are removed by using a combination of the Spot Healing Brush Tool, Clone Stamp Tool and several other tools. This is an example of what the weapon looks like once all editing has been finished.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Fourth Photoshop Example" alt="Fourth Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/fourth-photoshop-example.png">
                        <p>After this I add some color correction layers onto the weapon to spice it up. These are Vibrance & Brightness/Contrast. See below.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Fifth Photoshop Example" alt="Fifth Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/fifth-photoshop-example.png">
                        <p>The next steps are introducing the background layer which I reposition into an ideal location. The goal is to showcase the weapon in the foreground and the other stuff in the background. I then add some color correction layers onto the background layer as well as some effects. These effects include Sharpening & Radial Blur. This is what it looks like once the effects have been applied.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Sixth Photoshop Example" alt="Sixth Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/sixth-photoshop-example.png">
                        <p>After the effects have been applied, I click CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + E to combine all my layers into one and then I click CTRL + SHIFT + A to open Camera Raw. The best way to explain this tool is importing and enhancing raw images which is a must-have tool for professional photographers, etc. It's very similar to Adobe Lightroom but it's a tool in Adobe Photoshop. This is what it looks like once the Camera Raw menu has been opened, there's a lot of stuff which you can change but I've found a way which I like doing it.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Seventh Photoshop Example" alt="Seventh Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/seventh-photoshop-example.png">
                        <p>Here is what it looks like once the settings have been applied.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Eighth Photoshop Example" alt="Eighth Photoshop Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/photoshop/eighth-photoshop-example.png">
                        <p>And we are finished! This is how I make my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Martonic">YouTube</a> Thumbnails with several examples shown below.</p>

                        <p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline based video editing software developed by Adobe. Some features include automatic captions, colour matching and access to Adobe Stock assets. It was originally released in 2003.</p>
                        <hr class="thematic-break">
                        <p>My workflow invovlves extensive usage of Adobe Premiere Pro as I produce videos as a hobby. Here's a project which I recently worked on. It's a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10059070?hl=en">YouTube Shorts</a> video with a 1080x1920p resolution. This is the opposite of 1920x1080p which is the standard for 16:9 content but this is vertical content so it's got a 9:16 aspect ratio.</p>
                        <div class="youtube-embed">
                            <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drphCDtIeZo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is the video file in Premiere Pro. It's an 11:10 second video with several video and audio tracks. I will explain all of the video & audio tracks right here. Let's start at the top. Video 4 has it's output hidden. Video 3 is the text "Follow For More!" at the bottom of the video. Video 2 is the text at the top of the video. This changes between two different versions. The first version is the 2009 version of the game and the second is the 2022 version of the game. Video 1 is the footage in the center of the video. Audio 1 is muted. Audio 2 is the music used in the video, this song is very popular on social media such as TikTok. Audio 3 is muted.</p>            
                        <img class="example-picture" title="First Premiere Pro Example" alt="First Premiere Pro Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/premiere-pro/first-premiere-pro-example.png">      
                        <p>Color Correction is often something which I include in my videos but for this vertical video I did not include it. This is what the Color Workspace looks like in Premiere Pro.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Second Premiere Pro Example" alt="Second Premiere Pro Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/premiere-pro/second-premiere-pro-example.png">
                        <p>This is what it looks like once I've applied some color correction onto the video. I slightly increase the sharpness & vibrance of the video and then greatly increase the saturation. This is often done for videos of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/au/en/warzone">Call Of Duty Warzone</a> and other games.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Third Premiere Pro Example" alt="Third Premiere Pro Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/premiere-pro/third-premiere-pro-example.png">
                        <p>Some of the other things which I edit is the volume of certain tracks such as my Microphone and Game Sound. This is accomplished in the Audio Workspace in Premiere Pro.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Fourth Premiere Pro Example" alt="Fourth Premiere Pro Example" src="source/images/adobe-creative-suite/premiere-pro/fourth-premiere-pro-example.png">
                        <p>After the video is edited, you need to export it so here is the Export panel on Premiere Pro. I've created two of my own presets for Normal Videos (16:9 1920x1080p) and Vertical Videos (9:16 1080x1920p). All of my videos are exported at 60fps.</p>

You will also be able to see some examples of how I've used Photoshop for the video thumbnails.</p>

                        <p>The Attachments column is the most complicated and took a bit of time to figure out. It uses something called <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7013992?hl=en">TextJoin</a> which combines text from multiple strings and/or arrays with a specific delimiter seperating the different texts. This pulls Attachments from Data and showcases it in a neatly organized manner. Cool right?</p>

                        <p>What's wonderful about this Spreadsheet is you can add more entries into Data and it automatically gets added into Loadouts. Additionally, this Spreadsheet will most likely update as I am constantly adding new entries into it.

                        <p>Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service which is included in the Google Workspace. Some features include storing, sharing and collaborating on files & folders from any mobile device, tablet or computer. It was originally released in 2012.</p>

                        <p>Most of the Google Workspace is based off Google Drive, this means that you can go onto your Drive and create new Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc files and put it into folders (organize). Here's a picture of my Warzone Loadouts folder which contains a Google Sheets file. Knowing how to use Google Drive is an essential skill as it's the base to learn other things such as Google Docs, Google Slides, etc.</p>

                        <p>The best part about the Google Workspace in general is how you can collaborate with other people on pretty much every single piece of software that they have in the suite. You could be editing a Google Docs file and your friend could also be editing the same file!</p>

                        <p>Trello is a web-based list-making application developed by Trello Enterprise, a subsidiary of Atlassian. It allows individuals or teams to stay on track and focus on work. It was originally released in 2011.</p>

                        <p>This program is one of my favorites as it allows you to stay organized. I use it for several personal projects (I won't be sharing images of these) but I have set up an <a href="https://trello.com/b/KClesAwa/testing-board">Example</a> Trello Board. There are 3 Categories and these are To Do List, Work In Progress and Completed. Inside of a Category you can add Cards and these hold information!</p>

                        <p>Here's a look at a Card. You can change the Title, add Labels, add Attachments, etc. There's so much you can do!</p>

                        <p>This is what the Labels menu looks like. You can assign Labels to a card by clicking on the Label which you want or you could create a new Label.</p>

                        <p>You can even assign Dates to certain Cards to say when they need to be completed! This is very useful.</p>
