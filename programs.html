                        <hr class="thematic-break">
                        <p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vzg_aCW5M24nSn_B7bZuPdpvW5M6YHlznCkJzpxYBhc/edit?usp=sharing">Spreadsheet</a> is created by me and is designed to show information about weapon attachments for players of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/au/en/warzone">Call Of Duty Warzone</a>. The game contains over 100+ weapons and you often need to dig through YouTube videos to find a set of attachments which are good to use, but this solves that. There are two Sheets, one is Loadouts and the other is Data. The Data sheet contains all of the information which is then displayed on the Loadouts sheet with better formatting. See below for examples.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="First Sheets Example" alt="First Sheets Example" src="source/images/google-workspace/sheets/first-sheets-example.png">
                        <p>Did you know that the rows 1-4 are sticky? So once more entries are added, you can see still what each column means!</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Second Sheets Example" alt="Second Sheets Example" src="source/images/google-workspace/sheets/second-sheets-example.png">
                        <p>I'm using an in-cell dropdown list to pick which game the weapon is from and to pick which type of weapon it is.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Third Sheets Example" alt="Third Sheets Example" src="source/images/google-workspace/sheets/third-sheets-example.png">
                        <p>Here's a better look at how the in-cell dropdown lists are created. It's added through Data Validation and you select List Of Items and then add a comma between each item. This specifically shows the List Of Items for the weapon type column.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Fourth Sheets Example" alt="Fourth Sheets Example" src="source/images/google-workspace/sheets/fourth-sheets-example.png">
                        <p>It's time to move onto the formulas used in the Spreadsheet. This first one shows how the Weapon Type is pulled from Data and is showcased on the Loadouts Sheet.</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Fifth Sheets Example" alt="Fifth Sheets Example" src="source/images/google-workspace/sheets/fifth-sheets-example.png">
                        <p>The Attachments column is the most complicated and took a bit of time to figure out. It uses something called <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7013992?hl=en">TextJoin</a> which combines text from multiple strings and/or arrays with a specific delimiter seperating the different texts. This pulls Attachments from Data and showcases it in a neatly organized manner. Cool right?</p>
                        <img class="example-picture" title="Sixth Sheets Example" alt="Sixth Sheets Example" src="source/images/google-workspace/sheets/sixth-sheets-example.png">
                        <p>What's wonderful about this Spreadsheet is you can add more entries into Data and it automatically gets added into Loadouts. Additionally, this Spreadsheet will most likely update as I am constantly adding new entries into it.

                        <p>Most of the Google Workspace is based off Google Drive, this means that you can go onto your Drive and create new Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc files and put it into folders (organize). Here's a picture of my Warzone Loadouts folder which contains a Google Sheets file. Knowing how to use Google Drive is an essential skill as it's the base to learn other things such as Google Docs, Google Slides, etc.</p>

                        <p>This program is one of my favorites as it allows you to stay organized. I use it for several personal projects (I won't be sharing images of these) but I have set up an example Trello Board. There are 3 Categories and these are To Do List, Work In Progress and Completed. Inside of a Category you can add Cards and these hold information!</p>
